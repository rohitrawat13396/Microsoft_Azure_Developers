1. Create VNet (define IP Address Range) - 10.0.0.0/24

2. Create subnets within VNet (Assign IP Add range - within VNet IP range) - 
	- subnet1 - 10.0.0.0/26
	- subnet2 - 10.0.0.64/26

3. Create NSG
	- No manual rules defined
	- There are 3 inbound and 3 outbound rules avilable

4. Attach/Associate the NSG to subnet
	- NSG -> Subnets -> Associate -> Selected our subnet

5. Create Public IP Address 
	- - Ipv4/Ipv6, Dynamic/Static, SKU, DNS Label

6. Create VM
	- Add VM name, size, image
	- Networking - vnet, subnet, public ip add (optional)
	- Management: Off

7. Do RDP
	- VM -> Connect -> RDP  (this should not work)

	- VM -> Networking -> Add inbound rule 
     	   - Source - Any, Dest - Any, Port - 3389, Protocol - Any, Allow Access, Priority - 1000 Provide a name - OK

	- VM -> Connect -> RDP -> Provide credentials (this should work)

8. Exercise:
	- Dont delete any existing rules. But now block the RDP access, using another inbound rule

	(Source - Any, Dest - Any, Port - 3389, Protocol - Any, Deny Access, Priority - 900, Add name - OK)

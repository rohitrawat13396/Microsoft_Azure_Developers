Region (not a country!)
	- east us, west us, east us 2, west us 2

	- one or more datacenters
	- you deploy your apps in a datacenter


3-tier architecture
	- Web Layer
	- Middle Layer
	- Data Layer

Q. Can we create multiple NICs and attach to it a VM?
A. Yes. VM will et multiple Pvt IP Addresses

- Firewall
	- It can be applied only at Virtual Network level
	- Using this, you can handle inbound and outbound traffic

- Network Security Group (NSG)
	- Set of rules that can handle inbound and outbound traffic
	- Can be applied at Subnet level or VM level

- 4 possible configurations
	- NSG at subnet level and NSG at VM level (Pro: Control, Con: Maintenance)
	- NSG at subnet level but not at VM level (Control all VMs but no maintenance problems -MS recommends)
	- No NSG at subnet level but NSG at VM level (too much of overhead to manage VMs)
	- No NSG at subnet level and no NSG at VM Level (exposing VMs - no security)


- To define IP range for Vnet/subnet - I need to use CIDR notation
	- 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.255 => 10.0.0.0/24

NSG (applied at VM)
	- Inbound rule
		- Source - External (user/app/load balancer/internet/ip address)
		- Destination - VM

	- Outbound rule
		- Source - VM
		- Destination - External

Q. Block all the traffic coming from IP address - 170.170.0.0 to your VM
A. Inbound rule
	- Source - IP Address
	- Destination - VM



Default inbound values
	- Src - Virtual network, Dest - VM
		- Any traffic originating within VNet and hitting my VM is ALLOWED

	- Src - Azure LB, Dest - VM
		- - Any traffic originating from LB and hitting my VM is ALLOWED

	- All rules combined together says - that any traffic from VNet or LB is allowed, else it is blocked

Public IP Addresses:
	- Dynamic
		- When you create it, actually IP Address is not assigned to you
		- ONly when you attach it to a resource (VM), then it will be assigned
		- You dont pay for it until is attached to a resource
		- If you restart your VM, then you may not get the same IP add back

	- Static
		- When you create it, IP address is assigned you.
		- You will start paying as soon it is created
		- Even if you restart VM, IP address will remain the same

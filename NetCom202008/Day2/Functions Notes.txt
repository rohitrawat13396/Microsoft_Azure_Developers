Azure Functions
	- Why?
		- Only few functions
			- Cleanup storage account
			- Archive data in DB
			- Send out a reminder to the team at 9AM everyday

		- A proj with very less functions
		- Utility fns - used across multiple projects
		- Some activities are not running frequently, they run occassionally.

		- If a file is uploaded into storage, I want to execute a function


	- True serverless
	- Function-as-a-service (FaaS)
	- Micro-micro-services

	- Dynamic scaling
		- Only pay for it, when you need it. Save cost
		- If req grows, you dont need to do any scaling. It scale dynamically.

- Blog
	- UNtil you are building a FB like site, Azure functions are almost free.

- Function App
	- No infra mgmt. PaaS service
	- Runs on Azure App Services
	- This means lot of features that you saw for App service are also available here
		- Deployment slots
		- Custom domain
		- SSL
		- Access Restrictions

- 2 types of plans
	- App Service PLan
		- Either create a new ASP (but dont do it) or use an existing ASP
		- There is default limit of 30 mins to the execution time of function
		- There is no max limit to the execution time of function - configure it to run as long as you want
		- No dynamic scaling

	- Consumption Plan
		- Number of executions * Amount of resources
		- Default time for completion of fn - 5 mins
		- Max time you can configure to complete the fn - 10 mins
		- Dynamic scaling

Two parts of a fn
	- Trigger
		- Http trigger, Timer trigger, Blob trigger, Queue trigger, service bus trigger...
	- Action
		- this is your code


Bindings
	- Input bindings
		- Example - Before your function starts, you want to extract some data from storage account
			  - Before your function starts, you want to extract some information from Cosmos DB

		- One way to do this is to write the code inside your fn, that will connect to storage account, get the data and then you can use it.
		- Or you can use input bindings
			- You can get the data even before your fn execution starts.
			- You dont have to write the code for extraction

	- Output bindings
		- There are times when you want to send out data to different services
		- Example - if my processing is complete, i want to store a message in azure queue

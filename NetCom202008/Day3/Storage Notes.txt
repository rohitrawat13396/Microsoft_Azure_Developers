Azure Storage
	- Blobs / Containers
		- You can store any kind of files
		- Uploading/downloading is very quick
		- It also supports streaming

	- Files
		- SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. You can go and map it as a network drive on PC

	- Queues
		- Senders can send the message to queue, and receivers can pick it up. FIFO

	- Tables
		- NoSQL Database. Key-value store

- When you create storage acc, you get 500 TB of space

- Assume that cost is $10/TB per month. If you keep only 10 MB of data for 10 mins, you pay on pr-rata basis.
- Network bandwidth 
	- Ingress is free
	- Egress is charged (in some cases it is free)


- Blobs
	- Container (doesnt have a folder structure)
		- PUblic access level
			- Private - not logged in -> no access
			- Blob - You must have the URL of the file you want to access (read only mode and not logged in). You cannot see which other files are present inside the container.
			- Container - Without logging in, you can go and see which files are present in the container, and read them.


	- Snapshot
		- Create snapshot - Its like a backup of your file. Its actually a pointer/ref to actual file
		- Promote snapshot - it will replace the current file with the snapshot file
		- Delete blob - First, delete the snapshots, then only you can delete the blob

	- Data protection
		- If you enable soft delete, the file will not be permanently deleted.
		- Only after the retention period, the file will be deleted permanently.
		- You can retrieve the file, but you cant retrieve the snapshots

	- Acquire lease
		- There are times when file can accidently deleted. Using lease, you can prevent accidental deletion
		- Once you acquire lease, a key will be generated. And those who have the key can modify or delete the file
		- If multiple people want to modify the file, one person can acquire the lease, and modify the file. Person can release/break the lease, then other people can modify the file.

	- Access Keys
		- Very powerful keys. It has full access to the storage account
		- NEVER SHARE THE ACCESS KEYS
		- Storage account level
		- IN your apps, DO NOT USE Access Keys

	- SAS - Shared Access Signatures
		- You can create a SAS at the storage account level or at the individual blob level
		- LImited right key

	- Max file size - 4.76TB

- Hands-on
- Hot/cool/archive
- Replication strategies


Example
	- You have a report.
	- For first month, lot of people frequently access the report
	- After one month upto one year, people acess the report sometimes
	- After one year, its rarely accessed. Infact its only reqd for govt audit purposes.

Save cost and get good performance
	- For the first month, you can store the file in HOt tier
	- From 2nd month to 12th month, you can store the file in Cool Tier. You can MOVE the file from hot to cool.
	- After 1 year, you can move the file to archive tier.

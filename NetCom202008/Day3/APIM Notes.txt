Mock API
----------
1. Create a new Blank API (Weather)
	- API suffix, api name

2. Create operations in the API
	- GetWeather

3. Test the operation and see the error (because there is no backend API available)

4. In GetWeather operation -> Inbound processing -> Add Mock response -> 200 OK (app/json)
	- Test as well to see you are getting 200 OK.

(You can setup rate limits if you want, by using rate-limit inbound policy)

5. In GetWeather operation -> Front-end -> Responses -> Add response (200 OK) 
	-> Add representation -> Content-type (application/json) 
	-> Sample (      { "currentweather": "25 deg" }          )

6. Test and see sample response showing up


Exercise
-----------
1. Import Azure Function 
2. In the response, add a header - x-powered-by: netcom
